# Response Format Contract

- Start with a short migration summary.
- Include risks/follow-ups only when they are actionable.
- Output each changed file in a separate code block.
- Use `file: <relative/path>` fence info for non-Dockerfile files.
- Always output full file content for changed files, not fragments.
